                <p>The Grey Knights are a unique and secretive Space Marine Chapter within the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Formed to combat the insidious 
                    forces of Chaos and daemonkind, they are the Emperor's own daemon hunters, dedicated to the defense of humanity against the supernatural 
                    threats that lurk in the Warp.</p>

                <ul class="faction-list">
                    <li>
                    Daemon Hunters: The Grey Knights are specifically created to combat the daemonic entities that emerge from the Warp. They are psychically 
                    attuned and equipped with specialized anti-daemon wargear, making them a formidable force against Chaos. Their primary mission is to hunt 
                    down and destroy any manifestations of Chaos, ensuring the protection of the Imperium.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Psychic Prowess: Grey Knights are psykers of exceptional power. Their psychic abilities are honed to combat daemonic entities, allowing 
                    them to banish, disrupt, or destroy warp-spawned threats. The Grey Knights' psychic mastery is vital in countering the daemonic forces 
                    that conventional weaponry often struggles to harm.

                    <li>
                    Chapter's Origin: The Grey Knights' creation is shrouded in secrecy. They were founded by the Emperor himself and are directly linked to 
                    the Ordo Malleus, the Inquisition's branch dedicated to combating daemonic threats. Their gene-seed is unique, making them resistant to the 
                    corrupting influence of Chaos.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Titanic War Machines: The Grey Knights have access to potent war machines, including the Grey Knight Dreadnoughts and the formidable Nemesis 
                    Dreadknight. These machines are often deployed to deal with the most powerful daemon threats. The Dreadknight, in particular, is a towering 
                    exoskeleton armed with powerful weaponry, piloted by a Grey Knight warrior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Daemonhammers and Nemesis Force Weapons: Grey Knights wield advanced weaponry designed specifically for combating daemons. Daemonhammers are 
                    massive power weapons, while Nemesis Force Weapons can disrupt and banish daemonic entities. These weapons are instrumental in the Grey Knights' 
                    ability to engage and defeat even the most powerful daemonic adversaries.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The Grey Knights are an elite and secretive Space Marine Chapter with a singular purpose - the eradication of daemonic entities. Endowed with 
                    potent psychic abilities and equipped with anti-daemon weaponry, they stand as humanity's bulwark against the supernatural threats that emerge 
                    from the Warp. Founded by the Emperor himself, the Grey Knights exemplify a unique and vital force in the grim and perilous future of the 41st 
                    millennium.</p>
