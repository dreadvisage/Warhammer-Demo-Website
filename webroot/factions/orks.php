                <p>The Orks, also known as Greenskins, are a brutal and warlike xenos race in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Unbeknownst to them, their latent psychic 
                    abilities shape reality, allowing their ramshackle technology to function and their Waaagh! energy to propel them on a perpetual path of conquest.

                <ul class="faction-list">
                    <li>
                    Waaagh! Energy: Orks generate a psychic field collectively known as Waaagh! This energy is fueled by their aggressive tendencies and shared 
                    belief in the effectiveness of their technology. It influences reality, making Ork technology work despite its seemingly haphazard construction. 
                    Waaagh! also manifests in massive Ork armies, providing them with enhanced strength, speed, and coordination in battle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Clans and Tribes: Orks are organized into various clans, each with its unique culture, colors, and combat specialties. Notable clans include the 
                    Goffs, known for their brutal melee combat, and the Bad Moons, who favor flashy displays of wealth and have a love for dakka (firepower). Ork 
                    society is tribal and hierarchical, with the biggest and meanest Orks often rising to leadership positions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Mekboyz and Gretchin: Mekboyz are Ork engineers who possess an instinctive understanding of technology. They create bizarre and often effective war 
                    machines, from ramshackle tanks to massive Stompas. Gretchin, smaller and weaker members of the Ork race, serve as laborers and support staff. Despite 
                    their diminutive size, they play crucial roles in Ork society.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Love for Violence: Orks have an innate love for violence and combat. They relish in the thrill of battle, and the strongest Orks are often those who 
                    survive the longest in the chaotic melee. Their culture revolves around the concept of "might makes right," with constant infighting and challenges for 
                    dominance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Endless Conquest: Orks are constantly driven by a desire for "da biggest Waaagh!" This insatiable thirst for warfare leads them to launch Waaagh! after 
                    Waaagh!, spreading across the galaxy and causing widespread destruction. Orks invade planets, loot resources, and engage in epic battles against any and 
                    all opponents, be they other xenos, heretics, or the Imperium of Man.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Orks, driven by an instinctual love for violence and fueled by the Waaagh! energy, are a constant and formidable threat in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. 
                    Organized into diverse clans, with a unique approach to technology and warfare, Orks embody the anarchic and chaotic nature of the galaxy in the grim 
                    and perilous future of the 41st millennium.</p>
