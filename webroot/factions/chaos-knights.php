                <p>Chaos Knights, also known as Renegade Knights, are a malevolent and twisted faction within the Warhammer 40,000 universe. These 
                    towering war machines, once noble protectors of humanity, have fallen to the corruption of Chaos and now serve the dark powers 
                    of the Warp.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Corrupted Nobility: Chaos Knights were once part of the Knightly Houses, noble traditions dedicated to protecting humanity. 
                    However, many have turned to Chaos, becoming Renegade Knights, driven by dark desires and the lure of power from the Warp. This 
                    fall to corruption has transformed them into malevolent war machines.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Dark Allegiances: Chaos Knights pledge allegiance to the Chaos Gods or align themselves with the broader forces of Chaos. They 
                    bear the marks and iconography of their chosen deity, such as Khorne, Tzeentch, Nurgle, or Slaanesh. These allegiances grant them 
                    unique abilities and powers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Cursed Machines: Chaos Knights are colossal bipedal war engines, often heavily adorned with spikes, chains, and blasphemous symbols. 
                    They are armed with devastating weaponry, including rapid-fire battle cannons, chainswords, and harpoons. These weapons are often 
                    corrupted and fueled by daemonic energies, causing immense devastation on the battlefield.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Daemonic Possession: Many Chaos Knights are possessed by daemons, further enhancing their combat prowess and resilience. These daemons 
                    may emerge to protect the Knight in battle or take control, turning the machine into an avatar of destruction. The constant struggle 
                    between the machine's pilot and the daemonic presence within makes Chaos Knights unpredictable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Raids and Pillaging: Chaos Knights are often involved in raiding and pillaging across the galaxy, seeking to sate their dark desires 
                    and serve the interests of Chaos. They are a constant threat to Imperial worlds and forces. Their actions are an affront to their former 
                    noble purpose and a source of despair for the Imperium.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Chaos Knights, once noble defenders of humanity, have been corrupted by Chaos and now serve dark powers. These towering, twisted war machines 
                    bear allegiance to the Chaos Gods, wield daemonic weaponry, and are often possessed by daemons. With their raider-like tendencies, Chaos 
                    Knights are a relentless menace to the Imperium, embodying the grim and perilous future of the 41st millennium.</p>
