                <p>The Astra Militarum, formerly known as the Imperial Guard, is the largest and most numerous military force within the Warhammer 40,000 
                    universe. Comprised of countless regiments from diverse planets, it forms the backbone of the Imperium's military might, defending 
                    it against a myriad of threats.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Planetary Regiments: The Astra Militarum is vast, consisting of regiments raised from countless Imperial worlds. Each regiment brings 
                    its unique traditions, culture, and fighting style to the battlefield. These regiments are typically equipped with a wide range of 
                    vehicles and weaponry, from simple lasguns to mighty tanks.

                    <li>
                    Imperial Tithes: Imperial worlds are required to provide troops to the Astra Militarum as part of their tithe to the Imperium, ensuring 
                    a steady supply of soldiers. Tithes vary in quantity and quality, leading to the formation of both elite regiments and poorly equipped, 
                    but determined, forces.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Command Structure: The Astra Militarum has a hierarchical command structure, with officers ranging from lowly commissars and company 
                    commanders to high-ranking generals. The Commissariat enforces discipline, sometimes ruthlessly, among the troops, ensuring their loyalty
                    to the Emperor.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Overwhelming Numbers: The Astra Militarum's greatest strength lies in its sheer numbers. It can field immense armies in battles against a 
                    wide range of adversaries, from alien threats to heretics and traitors. Their tactics often involve attrition warfare, relying on the 
                    relentless advance of troops to wear down the enemy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Guarding the Imperium: The Astra Militarum's primary role is to protect the Imperium and its worlds, defending the Emperor's domain from 
                    external and internal threats. They are often at the forefront of battles, tasked with the grueling and unenviable duty of holding the line 
                    against overwhelming odds.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The Astra Militarum, the Imperial Guard, is a colossal and diverse military force, made up of regiments from countless planets across the 
                    Imperium. Bound by their service to the Emperor, these regiments vary in quality but bring their unique skills and traditions to the 
                    battlefield. The Astra Militarum's overwhelming numbers and attrition-based tactics make it the first line of defense against the countless 
                    threats that assail the Imperium in the grim and perilous future of the 41st millennium.</p>
